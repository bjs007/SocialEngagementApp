# SocialEngagementApp

We have created a java based web application which runs in a tomcat server. The application uses MySql database.

## Summary of the project
This application will provide the old people a platform which will help them coordinate with society and get help 
for even the daily activities which they find difficult. For example, some seniors are no longer able to drive a car. 
Ideally, other people living in the same community can share them a ride if they all agree on the schedule they set before. 
Our application will offer two different roles. For the seniors, they can log in this application, creating, viewing and 
discussing social events. For staff members, they not only have the same privileges as the seniorsâ€™, but more privileges managing those activities. 
The application is designed for senior citizens, keeping in mind the factor of ease of use. Notifications, for example, 
will let the seniors know some kinds of social activities is coming.
We shall talk a bit more about each modules in more details below.
