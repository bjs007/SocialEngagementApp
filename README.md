# SocialEngagementApp

This application will provide the old people a platform which will help them coordinate with society and get help for even the daily activities which they find difficult. For example, some seniors are no longer able to drive a car. Ideally, other people living in the same community can share them a ride if they all agree on the schedule they set before. Our application will offer two different roles. For the seniors, they can log in this application, creating, viewing and discussing social events. What’s more, our application can also provide the seniors the interface to schedule the appointments with assistants or nurses from the care center. For staff members, they not only have the same privileges as the seniors’, but more privileges managing those activities. The application will specifically be designed for senior citizens, keeping in mind the factor of ease of use. Notifications, for example, will let the seniors know some kinds of social activities is coming.
This will enrich the quality of the seniors’ life. Providing them more convenient ways to get involved in more social activities and managing their own lives.
